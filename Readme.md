# StateMachine Node Editor

This repository holds the template code for creating StateMachines for AI-controlled
characters.

The StateMachine components are based on a modified version of the StateMachine
seen here: https://github.com/RMSpratt/Unity-AI-Templates/tree/main/StateMachine.

This Node editor hopes to provide a more designer-friendly method for designing complex
state machine behaviour for one or more game characters, (Agents).
